# Drum Kit Challenge

This is a simple drum kit project created as part of an online course. The app lets users play drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing specific keys on the keyboard.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:
```plaintext 
Drum Kit Challenge/ ├── images/ # Folder containing images (if any are used) 
├── sounds/ # Folder containing sound files for drum beats
├── index.html # HTML structure for the drum kit interface
├── index.js # JavaScript logic for sound and button interactions 
└── styles.css # CSS styling for the drum kit
```

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on the buttons labeled with "W", "A", "S", "D", "J", "K", and "L" to play different drum sounds.
3. Alternatively, press the corresponding keys on the keyboard to play the sounds.
4. Each button press or key press triggers a unique drum sound.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the drum kit interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the buttons and overall layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the sound effects, keypress events, and button animations.
- **Audio**: Drum sound files are stored in the `sounds` folder and are played on button or key press.

## Setup
